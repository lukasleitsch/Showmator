## What is *Showmator*?

Shownotes are common courtesy when publishing podcasts nowadays. Up until now, that meant a whole lot of work. With Showmator you neither have to re-listen to your last episode nor are you distracted with writing shownotes during the recording.  

Showmator is a browser extension for Google Chrome helping you create your shownotes&mdash;distraction free, nice and easy.
